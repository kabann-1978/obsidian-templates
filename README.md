# Obsidian Templates

This is a collection of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) templates I use or have used. Most of these use Templater (and its "Trigger on file creation" feature) but I'll list the plugins used for each one in the [overview below](#overview). You might also need to adjust folder paths and file names used in the Templater scripts. I've translated some metadata field names to English for readability.

## Overview
